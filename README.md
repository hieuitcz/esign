  <ol>
    <li>Click on <strong>Sync fork</strong>, and if your branch is out-of-date, click on <strong>Update branch</strong>.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the <strong>Actions tab</strong> in your forked repository and select <strong>Create IPA Packages</strong> if you're on desktop/widescreen. Tap on <strong>All Workflows</strong> and select <strong>Create IPA Packages</strong> if you're on mobile/portrait.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Run workflow</strong> button located on the right side.</li>
    <li>Prepare a decrypted .ipa file <em>(we cannot provide this due to legal reasons)</em>, then upload it to a file provider (e.g., filebin.net, filemail.com, or Dropbox is recommended). Paste the URL of the decrypted IPA file in the provided field.</li>
    <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to provide a direct download link to the file, not a link to a webpage. Otherwise, the process will fail.</li>
    <li>Go to the releases page of the EeveeSpotify repository (<strong>NOT</strong> the fork). Hold and copy the link of the .deb file, which corresponds to your phone's architecture.</li>
    <li>Make sure all inputs are correct, then click <strong>Run workflow</strong> to start the process.</li>
    <li>Wait for the build to finish. You can download the Hieudz IPA from the releases section of your forked repo. (If you can't find the releases section, go to your forked repo and add /releases to the URL, i.e., github.com/user/Hieudz/releases.)</li>
